  <h1>JavaScript Callback</h1>
  <p>JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called. Not in
    the sequence they are defined.
  </p>

  <h1>Sequence Control</h1>
  <p>To have a better control over when to execute a function, save the result
    then call another function to display the result.
  </p>
  <p id="seqControl"></p>

  <h1>JavaScript Callback</h1>
  <p>A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function</p>
  <p>Using the callback function, you can call the exam result and let the exam result function run the callback after the calculation is finished</p>

  <h1>When to use Callback function</h1>
  <p>Callbacks are really good in asynchronous functions, 
    where one function has to wait for another function- like waiting for a file to load
  </p>

  <h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
  <p>Functions that run parallel with other functions are called asynchronous
    a good example is JavaScript setTimeout()
